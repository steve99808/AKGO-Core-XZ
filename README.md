# AKGO-Core-XZ
Upgrades from an beginner printer to a reliable machine

Want to rebuild my very first printer, an Anycubic Kobra Go. It technically still works, but it has it's issues from production. 
Issues:
-Single Z-Axis
-Old Marlin Firmware
-Unreliable Leveling

Since it'll go to a person that's not that much into the technology and the tinkering part I want to build it as reliable as possible. 
My plan is to build it into a Core XZ with the following upgrades:
A lightweight XOL Toolhead, 
Klipper and a Canbus Connection for less cables to the toolhead, 
BIQU Microprobe for leveling, 
Sherpa Mini for extrusion 
MGH12 Linear Rails for X and Y Axis 

The project is just in the beginning stages so it's a work in progress. Pictures of the progress will follow
